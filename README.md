# django-login-with-otp

Here I have contributed a small Django application which uses Login using OTP instead of Django's default login.
For this application I have used custom user model instead the default one. You will also see how to use "AbstraceBaseUser" while implementing this demo.
I have also created a custom authentication in this application. Also, make sure to check the changes done in "settings.py" carefully.

Here, I have not used any SMS API or Email API. Instead, the OTP is printed on the console and you can copy and proceed with the verification.
Kindly, use your APIs accordingly. The user interface is created to demonstrate the basic operations only, you can make your own fancy UI.

I have tried to make a working application which can help the developers who are looking for login with otp example. Hope, this helps other developers in achieving their output.

Feel free to make comments, suggestion and corrections as well.

Thanks.
